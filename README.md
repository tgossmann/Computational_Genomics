## Practical: PheWeb

https://pheweb.jp/

This website releases genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of the BioBank Japan Project (BBJ). We provide GWAS results in the Japanese population (mainly from BBJ) using the PheWeb platform, with public access to the full summary statistics.

BBJ is a prospective genome biobank that collaboratively collected DNA and serum samples from 12 medical institutions in Japan, managed by the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo. BBJ has recruited approximately 260,000 participants, mainly of Japanese ancestry. All study participants had been diagnosed with one or more of 47 target diseases. RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences contributed to genotyping of the BBJ samples.

## Practical Swarm Genomics 

### Swarm Genome Data Mining: Determining genetic diversity captured in vertebrate reference genomes

Recent advances in sequencing technology have led to bloom of genomic resources, best illustrated by the numberof large-scale vertebrate genome projects (birds 10K, bat 1K). In the near future, reference genomes of almost anyspecies of interest might become available. But what can we learn from a single individualsâ€™ genome about the entirespecies? The aim of the Citizen Science Project it to explore what are the drivers of genetic diversity in deposited reference genomes. The project will be entirely computational and include aspects of population genetics as well as molecular evolution.
